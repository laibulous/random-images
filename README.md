# Image Hosting Repository

This repository is used for **personal image hosting** via GitHub.  
It stores images that I reference in projects, documentation, README files, and other personal use cases.

## Purpose

- Host static images using GitHub
- Use raw GitHub URLs for embedding images
- Avoid external image hosting services for small assets
- Keep reusable visual assets in one place

---

## Usage

Images in this repository can be accessed using GitHub’s raw content URLs.

### Example:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/repository-name/main/image-name.png

Replace:
- `<username>` with your GitHub username  
- `<repository-name>` with this repository name  
- `<image-name>` with the file name (including extension)

## Notes
